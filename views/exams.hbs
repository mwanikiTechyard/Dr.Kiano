            Good performance is the ultimate goal of our school and this is the
            expectation by the BOM, Parents, Teachers, Students and many other
            stakeholders. But good performance don’t just happen it’s always the
            result of high intention, sincere effort, well guided directions and
            skillful execution through the curriculum department. The school has
            continuously posted a positive index in the KCSE exams over the
            years.
            In 2022, the school emerged 3rd Boys county school within Kangema
            sub-county as a result of selfless stewardship of our principal Mr
            J.N.Gicongi. Teamwork is our driving force and our collective
            efforts
            have led to timely syllabus coverage and creative academic programs
            ensures no learner is left behind in academic achievement Our
            performance for the last three years is as follows and we believe
            our
            2023 mean score target of above 5.0 is achievable.
